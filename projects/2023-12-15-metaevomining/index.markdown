# MetaEvoMining

## What is MetaEvoMining?

MetaEvoMining is a tool for the exploration of unknown enzymes using an
evolutionary approach. MetaEvoMining detects, through sequence homology,
those genes that have undergone expansion and identifies potential
candidates for enzymes recruited through natural selection for new/novel
biosynthetic pathways. MetaEvoMining searches for differences among
homologous sequences from organisms that share a common evolutionary
lineage.
